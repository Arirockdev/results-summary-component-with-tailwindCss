```

2. open the `index.html` file in your browser



## For the app i used

- HTML

- Css and Css Tailwind

- Javascritp:

  I created a json file with all the item data, and I used a fetch to use the API and print them to the dom. I chose to do it this way to give a little variety to the original challenge, which is also a little easier and simpler than this one.
